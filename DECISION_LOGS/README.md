# Decision Logs

## Policy
- **Append-only**: Decisions, failures, and rejection reasons must be logged here. Never delete old entries.
- **Traceability**: Decisions should link back to the relevant Specification and Phase.

## Naming Convention
- Project-specific logs: `DECISION_LOG_<PROJECT_KEY>.md`
  - Example: `DECISION_LOG_BUYMA.md`
- Use the template `DECISION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` to start a new log.
